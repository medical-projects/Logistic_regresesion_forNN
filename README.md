# Logistic_regresesion_forNN
* This project was made for medical students who are interested in Neural Network & Deep Learning
(Of course, anybody who want to learn NN can step on it)
* This project's task is to classify the images to 1(human face) or 0(non-human face)
* Contains very basic theories of first step of NN
* All Lectures were proceeded with Korean, so codes contain Koreans
* The dataset will not be given, so if you run this project, before run the code, make your "trainingset.hdf5" and "testset.hdf5" with your own image files (visit https://github.com/medinfoman/hdf5)


* I made this project by referring some lectures, so some parts can be similar to the code from the lectures.
